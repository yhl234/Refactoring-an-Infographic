				<h3>ELECTRICITY</h3>
				<p>
					Most households and small businesses pay time-of-use electricity
					prices that appear on the “Electricity” line of the bill. As the
					regulator, the OEB sets electricity prices twice a year: May 1 and
					November 1. Prices are based on the estimated cost to supply
					electricity in the province for the next six months.
				</p>
			</div>
			<!-- End green -->
			<!-- yellow -->
			<div>
				<h3>DELIVERY</h3>
				<p>
					This is made up of two separate costs. Both are approved by the OEB.
				</p>
				<h4>1. TRANSMISSION</h4>
				<p>
					Power flows from Ontario power plants and other sources, through
					transmission lines, to your local utility. Every home in Ontario pays
					the same rate to cover these costs.
				</p>
				<h4>2. DISTRIBUTION</h4>
				<p>
					A distribution company (also called “distributor” or “local utility”)
					delivers electricity to homes and businesses through a network of
					power lines within the communities it serves.
				</p>
			</div>
			<!-- end yellow -->
			<!-- Blue -->
			<div>
				<h3>REGULATORY</h3>
				<p>
					This is made up of the costs to administer the wholesale electricity
					system and maintain the reliability of the provincial grid. It also
					includes costs for funding Ministry of Energy conservation, renewable
					and low-income energy programs.
				</p>
			</div>
			<!-- End Blue -->

				<h3>GLOBAL ADJUSTMENT AND ENERGY CONTRACTS</h3>
				<p>
					If you buy electricity from your utility, the electricity price
					already includes your share of the “Global Adjustment.”
					<em
						>If you sign a contract with an energy retailer, you pay the
						agreed-upon contract price (not time-of-use or tiered prices set by
						the OEB). You will also need to pay your share of the Global
						Adjustment.</em
					>
					It will appear as a new, separate line on your utility bill.
