					<h3>ELECTRICITY</h3>
					<p>
						Most households and small businesses pay time-of-use electricity
						prices that appear on the “Electricity” line of the bill. As the
						regulator, the OEB sets electricity prices twice a year: May 1 and
						November 1. Prices are based on the estimated cost to supply
						electricity in the province for the next six months.
					</p>
				</div>
				<!-- End green -->
				<!-- yellow -->
				<div>
					<h3>DELIVERY</h3>
					<p>
						This is made up of two separate costs. Both are approved by the OEB.
					</p>
					<h4>1. TRANSMISSION</h4>
					<p>
						Power flows from Ontario power plants and other sources, through
						transmission lines, to your local utility. Every home in Ontario
						pays the same rate to cover these costs.
					</p>
					<h4>2. DISTRIBUTION</h4>
					<p>
						A distribution company (also called “distributor” or “local
						utility”) delivers electricity to homes and businesses through a
						network of power lines within the communities it serves.
					</p>
				</div>
				<!-- end yellow -->
				<!-- Blue -->
				<div>
					<h3>REGULATORY</h3>
					<p>
						This is made up of the costs to administer the wholesale electricity
						system and maintain the reliability of the provincial grid. It also
						includes costs for funding Ministry of Energy conservation,
						renewable and low-income energy programs.
					</p>
				</div>
				<!-- End Blue -->
				<!-- White -->
				<div>
					<h3>GLOBAL ADJUSTMENT AND ENERGY CONTRACTS</h3>
					<p>
						If you buy electricity from your utility, the electricity price
						already includes your share of the “Global Adjustment.”
						<em
							>If you sign a contract with an energy retailer, you pay the
							agreed-upon contract price (not time-of-use or tiered prices set
							by the OEB). You will also need to pay your share of the Global
							Adjustment.</em
						>
						It will appear as a new, separate line on your utility bill.
					</p>

				<h2></h2>
				<p><em></em><em></em><em></em></p>
				<p>
					Your smart meter tells your utility exactly how much power you use and
					when you use it. With this information, your utility charges you for
					the amount of power you use at off-peak, mid-peak and on-peak times.
				</p>
				<p>REASONS FOR DIFFERENT PRICES</p>
				<p>
					<em>WHEN DEMAND IS LOW</em>and fewer people are using power,
					lower-cost electricity is available from sources like nuclear and
					large hydroelectric systems.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>WHEN DEMAND RISES</em>during the day, the province’s supply of
					lower-cost electricity is used up, and more expensive sources need to
					be used.

				<h2>MANAGING YOUR ELECTRICITY USE</h2>
				<p>
					Did you know about 60% of energy costs in a typical home are spent on
					heating and cooling? To manage electricity use, try conserving power
					and shifting some usage to evenings and weekends. Visit these websites
					for more tips:
